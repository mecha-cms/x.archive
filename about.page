This extension enables the time filter feature by using the page’s `time` property to add multiple routes, such as
`http://127.0.0.1/blog/archive/:archive/1`, to each page to allow users to list all pages in the current folder by time.

As a note, every time you want to link a page to a specific year-based archive, be sure to add the pagination offset to
the end of the URL to prevent Mecha from misinterpreting the archive query as a pagination offset or individual page
name:

### Usage

These HTML classes will be added to the root element if it contains a `class` attribute when you are on the archives
page. You can use this feature to create a specific look or response on your site from the client side if the following
classes are found in the root element:

`is:archives`
: Will be added if the current items view is an archives view and is not empty.

Example usage in CSS code:

~~~ .css
.is\:archives body {
  border-top: 4px solid #f00;
}
~~~

Example usage in JS code:

~~~ .js
if (document.documentElement.classList.contains('is:archives')) {
    console.info('You are currently in the archives page.');
}
~~~

These additional conditional statements are available for use in layouts to show/hide elements on your site from the
server side:

`$site->is('archives')`
: Returns `true` if the current items view is an archives view and is not empty.

Example usage in HTML/PHP code:

~~~ .html.php
<?php if ($site->is('archives')): ?>
  <p role="alert">
    <?= i('You are currently in the archives page.'); ?>
  </p>
<?php endif; ?>
~~~

These additional variables are available for use in layouts that carry data related to the currently active archives
page:

`$archive`
: This variable is an instance of the `Time` class, which you can use to get the archive time portion of the URL.

Example usage in HTML/PHP code:

~~~ .html.php
<?php if ($site->is('archives') && !empty($archive)): ?>
  <p role="alert">
    <?= i('Showing archives back in year %d.', $archive->year); ?>
  </p>
<?php endif; ?>
