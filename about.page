This extension activates the time filter feature by utilizing the `time` property of the page to add several routes such as `http://127.0.0.1/blog/archive/:archive/1` on every page to allow users to list all pages in the current folder by time.

As a note, every time you want to link a page to a specific year-based archive, be sure to add the pagination offset to the end of the URL to prevent Mecha from mistakenly interpret the archive query as pagination offset or as individual page name:

~~~ .txt
